		<div>Ms. Caine reported that at about 7:30, after dinner had ended, everyone went to watch the fireworks show on the deck. At that time, she went to the kitchen to clean up.
</div>
		<div>“It was right on 8:15 when I heard the shouting. I saw everyone run from the deck to the office. The lawyer was banging and yelling on the door, Mr. Hunt managed to break down the door. That's when we all  saw the body.“
</div>

		<div>Kerri's interview recoding</div>
		<div>“It must have been around 8pm when I left John in his office to go to the bathroom. Then I went to the kitchen to ask Susan for a fresh glass of wine...“
</div>
		<div>Mr. Hunt also shared that it is “common knowledge“ that Mr. Pryce loved Mrs. Danes but Mr. Danes proposed first.
</div>
		<div>Logan's interview recoding</div>
		<div>“I don't like to gossip about other people, but dinner was late because we couldn't find Dan or Alicia. It was about 15 minutes later that they came down from upstairs together. I'm not sure, but Alicia's face looked a bit red. She was a bit off all night
</div>
		<div>No updates</div>
		<div>Mrs. Danes reports that her husband and his lawyer left and went straight to his office to talk about “some private business.” She says it was about 7:35. “I can't believe he missed the fireworks, after all the effort I put in planning it!”
</div>
		<div>"The fireworks show was such a wonderful idea. I was worried the cost wouldn't be worth it, but what a great way to end the evening!"
